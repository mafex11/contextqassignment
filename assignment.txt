Web Scraping News from Different Countries 
using RSS Feeds 
 
Title: Web Scraping and Data Extraction 
 
Selection competitive Key creterias: Selected intern would have demonstrated competitive 
edge making the code as comprehensive, generic and complete as time permits.  
 
Objective 
The purpose of this assignment is to evaluate candidates’ skills in web scraping, data extraction, 
and automation using RSS feeds. By the end of this assignment, candidate will: 
• demonstrate how to extract structured news data from different countries. 
• Work with RSS feed parsing in Python. 
• Store and process the extracted data. 
• Handle common web scraping challenges such as encoding, rate limits, and missing data. 
 
Task Overview 
You  will  develop  a  Python  program  to  scrape  news  headlines  and  summaries  from  at  least 
twenty different countries (the more you do, the better) using publicly available RSS feeds from 
major news agencies. The extracted data should be stored in a structured format (CSV, JSON, 
or a database). Extract historical data as well for atleast past one year. 
 
Requirements 
1. Data Collection 
• Identify and select at least twenty different news RSS feeds from different countries (e.g., 
BBC for the UK, CNN for the US, Al Jazeera for the Middle East, NHK for Japan, India, 
Singapore,  Malaysia,  Indonesia,  Korea,  China,  USA  and  other  countries  popular  news 
papers – find the list of them all first). Extract historical data as well for atleast past one 
year. If you want to include other countries, feel free. Think of all the different news 
papers, articiles in a country and try to structure it as comprehensive as possible. 
 
• Find as much as information as you can but aim for at least the below fields from each 
RSS feed: 
o News Title 
o Publication Date 
o Source (News Agency) 
o Country 
o Summary/Description 
o News URL (Link to Full Article) 
2. Data Storage & Formatting  
• Store the extracted data in CSV or JSON format. Or any other consistent format. 
• Ensure proper encoding to handle non-English characters (UTF-8). 
• Remove duplicate or irrelevant entries. 
3. Code Implementation 
• Use Python with BeautifulSoup or feedparser to parse RSS feeds. Or feel free to use 
others if you so wish. 
• Implement error handling (e.g., handling missing fields, network failures). 
• Modularize code using functions and classes where appropriate. 
• Add comments explaining each section of the code. 
• Feel free to use chatgpt and Claude ai or any other LLM. 
4. Advanced Features  
You demonstrate your enhanced skills by implementing any of the following: 
• Store data in SQLite/PostgreSQL database or any other format if you so wish, instead of 
CSV/JSON. 
• Create a simple Flask/Django API to serve the news data. Or any other way if you so 
wish. 
• Add a language detection feature to categorize news by language. 
• Implement scheduling (cron jobs) to update the feed automatically. 
 
Technical Guidelines 
1. Programming Language: Python 
2. Required Libraries: 
o feedparser (for RSS parsing) 
o BeautifulSoup4 (for HTML parsing, if needed) 
o pandas (for data storage in CSV/JSON) 
o sqlite3 (for optional database storage) 
o requests (for handling network requests) 
o any other libraries of your choice 
 
3. Development Environment: Jupyter Notebook / VS Code / PyCharm 
4. Submission Format: 
o Python script (.py file) or Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb). 
o Sample output file (CSV/JSON). 
o A short README.md explaining how to run the script. 
 
Example RSS Feeds 
Here are some example RSS feeds you can use: 
• BBC News (UK): http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/rss.xml 
• CNN (US): http://rss.cnn.com/rss/edition.rss 
• Al Jazeera (Middle East): https://www.aljazeera.com/xml/rss/all.xml 
• NHK (Japan): https://www3.nhk.or.jp/rss/news/cat0.xml 
 
Submission Instructions 
1. Upload your Python script or Jupyter Notebook to your GitHub. 
2. Attach your CSV/JSON output file. 
3. Include a README.md explaining: 
o How to install dependencies. 
o How to run the script. 
o Any issues encountered. 
4. If you implemented bonus features, highlight them in your README.
